                <h3>Self updates</h3>
                Service Workers can update themselves automatically, woohoo! However, it is best practice to inform the user about a new available version and 
                give her the possibility of choosing when to apply the update. Typically this is done through a UI element, like a button or banner. 
               
                <h3>Safety first</h3>
                Service Workers works only on a secure connections (HTTPS). Localhost is considered also <i>secure</i> and developers like it!
